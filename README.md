# Grading Requirement
    
Repository contains quality README file with description, screenshot, and link to deployed application.

# Project Description

The objective of this exercise is to produce a portfolio page from scratch utilizing core skills, such as flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables to showcase samples of my work.

Criteria of note include the following:
> Ensure that a potential employer could...
>> - load the portfolio and be presented with my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.
>
>> - click on one of the navigation links and have the UI scroll to the corresponding section.
>
>> - click on my work section and have the UI scroll to titles images of my applications.
>
>> - be presented with primary application whose image is larger in size than the others.
>
>> - click on each application's image and be redirected to the deployed application.
>
>> - be presented with a responsive layout that adapts to changes in viewport size via page resizing or viewing the site on various screens and devices.

I was able to achieve these goals mostly; however, I'm not entirely pleased with the results. I realize that this will be an on-going process. I have yet to decide as to whether I'll continue with the current route or scrap this attempt and start from scratch as my understanding of the concepts in use here are much better than when I started. I look forward to being able to compare the differences in my progress.
